# Code Test: 'Factoid Cards'

## Overall Requirements
Create an application to feature one of your extracurricular interests. Select an interest that has items of alike members (Stamps, Books, Songs, etc). Please use this as a chance to showcase your personality by selecting a category of things you enjoy.

The application should have a frontend for a web browser and a backend in node.js, use whatever libraries you are most familiar with otherwise.

The point of this test is to understand how you approach a technical problem. The way you code is just as important as your solution.

We expect this test to take you about 6 - 10 hours. Given that most people are busy, We'd like to hear back from you within 72 hours of starting.

#### As soon as you begin:
* [X] Fork this repository into a public repository on your github/etc account

#### While working on this, please:
* [ ] Commit early and often. I'll likely be following along with your progress.

#### Upon completing this, please post to us:
* [ ] A link to your git repository such that we may view your code.
* [ ] A link to somewhere where we may interact with a demo of your finished product

## Front End Requirements

The User Interface should be made out of a MVVM or MVC style frontend technology, using an asynchronous transport technology to talk to your backend.

#### The user interface should present a card like entry containing
* [ ] A small picture of the item
* [ ] A description of the item
* [ ] A fun factoid for the item

#### Interactions
* [ ] The user should be able to dismiss the currently presented card away making it disappear and presenting the next card in the stack.
* [ ] The user should be able to create their own factoid to be added to the fact stack.

## Backend Requirements

The Backend should be node.js with whatever middlewares you'd like to use.

#### Interactions to support
* [X] Please provide a RESTful backend for the CRUDL of factoids
* [X] Factoids should be transported to the UI via JSON
* [X] Factoids should be stored in some sort of SQL/NoSQL/Flat File on the backend

## BONUS

If you're too cool for school and knocked all the above out already, consider adding some improvements to what you've made.

### Suggestions for improvements
* [X] Integrate this with an external Service or API
* [ ] Write a test or two
* [ ] Add CD/CI to your project
* [ ] Edit this ReadMe with new suggestions for how to improve this code test
